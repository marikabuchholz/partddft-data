`input_files.py` holds functions that get strings for the pw-in,
tddft-in, and .sbatch files. You shouldn't have to do anything with
this file yet.

`setup.py` is similar to what you have been working on. Take a look at
this to see how it is working.

To run, type:

   python setup.py default

Eventually we will add more functions so that setup.py can take more
command-line arguments than just 'default'
